/**
 * Decides, from the requests the WebView reports, when the user is signed in

 * counts once a request carrying it to a signed-in-only endpoint answers 2xx;
 * with no such endpoints known, any 2xx will do. This keeps a guest token
 * (sent before sign-in) from being mistaken for a real one.
 *
 * It uses `extractCredential` and `matchesPathTemplate` from raidr_types, so
 * the "what is the token" logic lives in one place across all three callers.
